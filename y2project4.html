                           <p>For this project I teamed up with a course mate with the goal of improving on the original robot we designed and built for the transmedia 2019 show. For this robot we decided instead of it being able to drive itself, we would develop a way for visitors to drive it along with adding a mechanical arm for them to complete a task with on the show day.

                                <div class="half">

                        </div>
                        <p>We started by looking at the ups and downs for the original robot we made and how we could improve on it. The main points we outlined were:
                            Low Budget
                            Lack of shell
                            Not enough power
                            People were unable to interact with it
                             </p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Time Management & Budget</h2>
                        <div class="imgs">
                                <div class="half">
                                        <img class="responsive" src="img/robot2.jpg">
                                    </div>

                        </div>
                        <p>As this was a more complex robot, we had to manage our time effectively and make sure everything came together ready for the show. We did this by analysing what needed to be done and how long it would roughly take to complete each section of the robot. Due to the current world situation however, the show had been postponed and I was able to map out a new time management plan and update what I was able to do with the robot in the time given.
                            </p>
                        <p>We had a budget of around Â£200 to create the robot as some of the main chassis pieces and the addition of an arm were quite expensive, after looking at the options available we built a parts list of what we needed. This list was added to over the period of the original time management chart as we ran into problems through the development process as I will go into detail with further down.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Parts</h2>
                        <div class="imgs">
                            <div class="half">
                                <img class="responsive" src="img/robot3.jpg">
                            </div>
                            <div class="half">
                                <img class="responsive" src="img/robot5.jpg">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This was the original set of parts I started off with and what they originally looked like after assembling them individually, one of the initial problems with the chassis was the main platform of the chassis was two high up which was sorted through 3D printing. 
                            3D printing allowed the use of cheap lightweight parts to reduce weight throughout the robot and add our own custom feel to the robot as there were many aspects we needed to upgrade the robot and give it our own custom feel.
                            With the 3D printed parts, we were able to lower the chassis to height we wanted and replace parts of the arm to reduce the amount of servos as we did not need all of the servos on the arm.We also printed a second layer to create a multi-story chassis as all the internal electronics would not fit onto the original chassis.
                                </p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Aesthetics</h2>
                        <div class="half">
                            <img class="responsive" src="img/robot4.jpg">
                        </div>
                            <p>Another improvement we made to the arm in particular was the claw, the original claw looked a bit bland and boring and we wanted to make out own to still be both functional and improve upon the overall look of the robot.</p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Paint</h2>
                        <div class="imgs">
                        <div class="half">

                        </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>We spray painted all the chassis and arm black as the 3D printed bits were blue and was not matching with the main chassis. We are planning on adding a shell to the robot to cover up the electronics and give it a second colour, and mainly so the robot looks cooler..</p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Lighting</h2>

                        </div>
                        <p>We also got some RGB lighting to give the robot an underglow to make it look a lot cooler!</p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Development</h2>
                        <div class="imgs">
                            <div class="half">
                                    <img class="responsive" src="img/robot10.jpg">

                                </div>
                    </div>
                        <p>To get the robot functioning I used an Arduino Uno board along with the Arduino IDE to program it, to get the arm working, I used a servo library to get the arm to move up and down and open and close the claw. This meant the program would be shorter as there are multiple elements that need to go into the program.</p>

                        <p>To get the robot to be interactive with the visitors of the robot, I used a simple IR remote and receiver to allow visitors to both drive and move the robot themselves. Again, I used a library for this to shorten the amount of lines needed to program the robot. I started by writing a program which allowed me to get the hex codes for the button inputs which allowed me to write if statements for when a button was pressed on the remote. I then combined the two programs together to link up the arm controls to the remote.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="main-title">Future of the project</h2>
                        <p>Since the Transmedia show was pushed back to October, I have time to make improvements. One improvement I thought of was using a Bluetooth connection and developing a mobile app to control the robot as this would be more interesting and easier to use than an IR remote. </p>
