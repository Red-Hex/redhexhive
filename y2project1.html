                                                100”. A quick summary of the brief is how can we use Artificial
                                                Intelligence to help people live a happy, healthy 100-year life.

                                        <p>A platform for users to get updates about their current health and how they
                                                can improve it. The data from their current health is collected using
                                                implantable microchips which will measure data when an RFID chip is
                                                scanned using the provided scanner, and the web app. Every user will
                                                have their own unique ID through the use of microchipping which will
                                                enable them to log into their account through scanning their chip on the
                                                login page of the web app.

                                <p>For this project I had to write a case study as well as build a prototype for my
                                        solution so my research I did for the case study linked together with what I
                                        wanted to make for solution to this brief. After analysing the brief and
                                        highlighting the important facts of what my solution should look like, I began
                                        to research Microchipping and the uses it has in the medical industry followed
                                        by researching Artificial Intelligence and the impact it can have on the medical
                                        industry.
                                        From my research I learned that there were many ways that microchip technology
                                        was used throughout the medical industry and can measure a person’s pulse, which
                                        is what I wanted to my microchip to do but only when scanned on the web app.

                                <p>For my initial brainstorm I had a few ideas about an AI companion of sorts that would
                                        look after your health, from this brainstorm I narrowed down to a web app
                                        companion or a physical robot companion. After considering the time I had to
                                        complete the project and what would be a more unique idea, I went ahead with the
                                        microchipping AI companion idea.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="main-title">Development of Ideas</h2>
                                <p>After fleshing out my idea more the solution would come down to three main
                                        components. A web app, a physical scanner and the implantable microchip.

                                <h2 class="main-title">Technologies</h2>
                                <p>For the web app I used PHP to create the front end and structure of the website, as
                                        well as a login and sign up form, and I created an SQL database for the backend
                                        using phpMyAdmin. Using PHP allowed me to create a full working prototype that
                                        can be added to over time before submission to the RSA and would also allow me
                                        to test my solution in the real world by getting users to sign up and have heir
                                        data in the database

                                        of one of the biggest concerns for my solution. My first idea was to encrypt the
                                        medical data but the problem with this was if a hacker was able to decrypt it,
                                        they would have access to everyone’s medical data.</p>

                                <p>One of the main problems I faced in this project was getting more than one card
                                        authorised on my scanner. I overcame this by adding in an eslseif statment
                                        in order to have two IDs be authorised on the scanner at the same time. This is
                                        only a temproary fix but shows the use of multiple RFID tags at the same
                                        time. I also had an issue of getting the correct heart rate reading, to fix this
                                        I added in a simple equation to calculate the BPM and display the correct
                                        number.
